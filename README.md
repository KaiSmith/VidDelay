VidDelay takes webcam footage and plays it back at a delay. This is useful for people who need to practice a particular technique for an activity such as juggling or athletics and allows them to examine their own form easily. Simply run the program and execute your move. You can put all of your focus into the move and then shift your attention to the instant replay in order to examine your technique and form. If it looks good, you can save it. It is implemented using loop recording so you can leave the program running without eating up your memory.
